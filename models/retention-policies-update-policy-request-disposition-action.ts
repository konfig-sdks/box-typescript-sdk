 * @type RetentionPoliciesUpdatePolicyRequestDispositionAction
 * The disposition action of the retention policy. This action can be `permanently_delete`, which will cause the content retained by the policy to be permanently deleted, or `remove_retention`, which will lift the retention policy from the content, allowing it to be deleted by users, once the retention policy has expired. You can use \"null\" if you don\'t want to change `disposition_action`.
